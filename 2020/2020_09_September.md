## Details
DESCRIPTION:
Decision trees are easy to understand and form the basis for random forests, a powerful machine learning technique. In this meetup, we are excited to have a line-up of presenters to share how to engage with tree-based methods in R.

AGENDA:
This will be a virtual event on zoom. We will admit attendees from the waiting room at 6 pm!

(6:00 - 6:15) Welcome and Announcements

(6:15 - 6:45) Walkthrough of hierarchical clustering in R, presented by Kavana Rudresh.

(6:45 - 7:00) Trang Le will share an intro of her package, treeheatr (https://trang1618.github.io/treeheatr/), which creates interpretable decision tree visualizations with the data represented as a heatmap at the tree's leaf nodes.

(7:00 - 7:30) Decision trees vs random forests, presented by Karla Fettich
