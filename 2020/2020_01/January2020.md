# R-Ladies Philly January 2020 Meetup

**Resolutions 2020!**

## Details
For our January meetup we'll go over what we have achieved in the last year and where we are hoping to go in 2020. After the presentation, we will have some time to network and chat about all the exciting things to come.

Whether you have attended one of our previous meetups or not, anyone who supports our mission and has an interest in R is welcome. You can be an R expert or complete beginner!

In the first part of this meetup, we will (re-)introduce you to R-Ladies Philadelphia, which is celebrating a successful 2019. We will recap our programming and initiatives, how we have grown, and what we have learned. Looking ahead, we will discuss our plans for 2020 and how you can get involved. We would love to receive your input on what you’d like to see from R-Ladies Philly in the new year. Our annual member survey can be accessed from http://bit.ly/2019rladies. We would like to hear from you! It only takes 1~2 minutes.

The second part of the meetup will be geared towards networking with other attendees. The theme will be R-related new year’s resolutions. We will facilitate this networking session to help you meet attendees with similar resolutions or an expert who can recommend resources or strategies that can help you achieve your goals.
