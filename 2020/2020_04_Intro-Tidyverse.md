The tidyverse is a collection of R packages that share an underlying, opinionated approach to data structure and analysis. The workshop will cover the basic steps of a data science workflow, importing, wrangling, and visualizing data, using the core tidyverse packages. Familiarity with R and Rmarkdown will be useful, but not required. Complete novices are encouraged to attend! We'll be using RStudio Cloud for this workshop, so if you don't have an account, please sign up for a free one ahead of time at https://login.rstudio.cloud/register.

## About our speaker:

The Coriell Institute for Medical Research was founded in 1953 by virologist Dr. Lewis L. Coriell. Dr. Coriell pioneered research in aseptic cell culture and cryopreservation of cell lines, eventually leading the Coriell Institute to become one of the first biobanks. Today, Coriell's mission is to advance scientific discovery by preserving and generating world-class biomaterials, while also conducting groundbreaking basic research in biobanking, personalized medicine, stem cell biology, and epigenetics.
