## Lightning talks:

Sheila Braun: Fairness while Sampling from Very Large Datasets

Social injustice can creep into samples from very large data sets that contain variables with unevenly represented levels---levels whose numbers may differ by orders of magnitude. In these cases, simple random sampling runs a high risk of completely missing small but important subgroups. Sheila Braun walks you through when, why, and how to alter your sampling methods to provide fair results for your analysis. Sheila is a seasoned statistical consultant from Vermont now working at CHOP in the Arcus project as a data instructor. She loves hearing about projects, so please seek her out to talk about yours.

Rajvi Mehta: Important Skills for Women in Data

Rajvi is a Data Scientist at Vanguard and Philadelphia Chapter Lead of Women in Data. Coming from a finance background with no experience in coding, she learned how to code during her Master of Quantitative Finance. After which she interned with a local hedge fund in Buffalo, New York and build a real-time financial model in Python. She believes that real success in a data world lies in implementing technical knowledge, maintaining strong relationships, and having the ability to simplify complex problems. As a community leader and chapter lead of Women in Data, she hopes to provide practical learning opportunities to anyone interested in a data career. In her talk, she will discuss skills that any women working in data should have.
