# Network Analysis
*Tuesday, October 8, 2019*

## Details
Networks, also referred to as graphs in mathematics, model multiple types of relations and processes in physical, social, biological, and information systems. This workshop will cover some basics of network components and graph theory, while specifically focusing on how to implement network analyses using R igraph object. The topics will include manipulation, measurement, and clustering of networks using igraph package and visualization with ggraph package. The workshop will end with a practice problem using real-world flight network data. Some familiarity with dplyr and ggplot will be useful and expected, but not required.
